**Objective**

Explain the objective of the original data visualisation and the targetted audience.  

The visualisation chosen had the following three main issues:

* Briefly explain issue 1
* Briefly explain issue 2
* Briefly explain issue 3

#### Code

The following code was used to fix the issues identified in the original. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
library(dplyr)

Cost_of_NaturalDisaster_in_US<- data.frame(
  Cost_of_events=c(850.5,236.6,206.1,119.9,53.6,43.1,27.6), Disaster_Type= factor(c('Tropical Cyclone','Drought','Severe Strom','Flooding','Wildfire','Winter Strom','Freeze'), 
                                                    levels = c('Tropical Cyclone','Drought','Severe Strom','Flooding','Wildfire','Winter Strom','Freeze'),
                                                    ordered = FALSE) )


Cost_of_NaturalDisaster_in_US<-Cost_of_NaturalDisaster_in_US %>% mutate(Percentage = Cost_of_events/1537.4*100, Propotion = '')

p1<-ggplot(data = Cost_of_NaturalDisaster_in_US,aes(x = Disaster_Type, y = Cost_of_events, fill = Disaster_Type))+
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,1000))+
  labs(title = "The Cost of Natural Disasters in the United States",subtitle = "Billion-dollar Events from 1980 to 2017", fill = 'Disaster Type', x= '', y='Cost of Events( USD billions)' ) +
  theme_classic()+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",colour = "black", width = .8)+
  scale_fill_manual(values =rev(c('#eff3ff','#c6dbef','#9ecae1','#6baed6','#4292c6','#2171b5','#084594')))+
  geom_text(aes(label=paste0(Cost_of_events,'B'), x= Disaster_Type), hjust = 0.5, vjust= -0.5, color='black',,family="Times New Roman",size = 5, facefont='bold')

p2<-ggplot(Cost_of_NaturalDisaster_in_US, aes(x = Propotion, y = Cost_of_events, fill = Disaster_Type)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.2)+
  coord_flip() +
  labs( caption = "Source: https://wwwclimate.gov", x='Proportion of Group',y='Cost of Events Hold (USD Billions)' ) +

  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(Percentage),'%') ), position = position_stack(vjust=0.8), vjust=-5, colour='black', size=3) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(Cost_of_events,'B')), position = position_stack(vjust=0.8), vjust=8, colour='black', size=2) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  scale_fill_manual(values =rev(c('#eff3ff','#c6dbef','#9ecae1','#6baed6','#4292c6','#2171b5','#084594')))+
  theme_minimal()
